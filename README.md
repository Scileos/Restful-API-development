304CEM Recipe API - Jonathan Moore

What is it?

My API at the core is a tool to manage nutrition. It takes a users input and
calls an external API for recipes with those ingredients.

It then uses all the ingredients in a recipe in a call to a different API and
gets all the nutritional information for that recipe.

It allows users to register and add to a favourites list as well
